    <ul>
        
        <li><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 30 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 10 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Servings:</strong> 4 Pizzas</li>
    
    </ul>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
    <li>¼ cup flour for dusting</li>
    <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
    <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2> 
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    
        <p>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</p>
  
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
        
        <p>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</p>
    
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    
        <p>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</p>
        
    <h3>Step 4</h3> 
   
        <p>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</p>
   
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
